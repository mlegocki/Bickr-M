# Bickr
### As part of FullStack Academy's 'Capstone Project', Bickr was developed over a 2-week period

Our capstone project at Fullstack Academy, Bickr is a social entertainment web application, in which users can connect with others to debate and discuss topics they are most passionate about. Viewers of each debate can vote on which debater had the most convincing argument or even join the contest themselves for a chance to earn ‘Cred’.
